CarbonDB
==============

CarbonDB is a [life cycle inventory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment) (LCI) [open dataset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) mainly centered on greenhouse gas and energy impacts. It is structured as a domain [ontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) in terms of the [Ressource Description Framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) (RDF) [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/) specification. Please feel free to contribute by submitting issues or directly submitting an improved version of the ontology. 

This project benefited from [research](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/b/Bertin:Benjamin.html) jointly carried on by [My C-Sense](http://www.myc-sense.com/) and computer science laboratory [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/front-page-en?set_language=en) from [Universit√© de Lyon](http://www.universite-lyon.fr/). Its main innovative feature is the fact that flows between processes can be defined at a [macro-level](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-32606-6_9), which makes the model easier to understand and maintain.
